# Guitar World

Guitar World is a simple program made to simulate and represent guitar-equipment and the use of it while also offering some guitar-teaching as well. Right now the program exclusively provides textual feedback for the user. 

The program only runs in the command prompt window and it can be designed to have the same theme which are displayed in the portfolio. 

### Requirements
* .NET Core App version 6.0 and runtime

### How to build and execute program
* Build (to compile the code): 'dotnet build'
* Execute: 'dotnet run'

### Development
Guitar World is still in development and more features will be added with time. One goal is to have a window open when the program has been launched to have the layout and resolution being independent of the command prompt.
